# 💤 LazyVim - Personal Configs


## Original Template 

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## Why?

I always spend some time making configs so it would be nice to just clone them across my machines.
